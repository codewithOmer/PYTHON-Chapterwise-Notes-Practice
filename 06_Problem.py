''' Write a python program to calculate the square of a number 
 entered by the user'''

a = int(input("enter your number  : "))

# print("The square of the number is", a*a) # here[ * ]is multiplication
print("The square of the number is", a**2)  # here[ ** ]is power


'''     Both are same ... But in python to represent power use [ ** ]
insted of [ ^ ]  and it is not valid in python'''
